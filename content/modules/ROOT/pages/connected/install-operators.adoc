= Install the OpenStack Operator

. Clone the Files Repo
+
In the bastion terminal, clone the repo and change directory to the files that we will used later in the lab
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
git clone https://github.com/rhpds/showroom-summit2025-lb1245-osp-on-ocp labrepo
cd labrepo/content/files
----

. Install the OpenStack Operators
+
The next step in installing the *OpenStack Operators* will be create the *openstack-operators* project for the RHOSO operators:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc new-project openstack-operators
----

. Create the `openstack` project for the deployed RHOSO environment:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc new-project openstack
----

. Configure the **Catalog Source, OperatorGroup and Subscription** for the **OpenStack Operator** using your registry:
+
Create the new **CatalogSource, OperatorGroup, and Subscription** CRs in the **openstack** namespace from **files/openstack-operators.yaml**:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-openstack-operator.yaml
----

. Install the operator using the Manual approval strategy. Confirm that an install plan has been created but not executed as it has not been approved. Type Control + C, to exit the wait command:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get installplan -n openstack-operators -w
----
+
.Sample Output
----
NAME            CSV                       APPROVAL   APPROVED
install-lfs4j   openstack-operator.v1.0.7   Manual     false
----

. Approve the installation of the operator by updating the approved field of the InstallPlan.
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc patch installplan $(oc get installplan -n openstack-operators | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $1}')  \
    --namespace openstack-operators \
    --type merge \
    --patch '{"spec":{"approved":true}}'
----

. Confirm the *openstack* operator is installed:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get clusterserviceversion -n openstack-operators \
 -o custom-columns=Name:.metadata.name,Phase:.status.phase -w
----
+
Type Control + C when you see that the operator has moved to Succeded state
+
.Sample Output
----
Name                                    Phase
openstack-operator.v1.0.9               Succeeded
----

. Initialize the operator:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc apply -f osp-ng-openstack-operator-init.yaml
----

. Confirm that you have installed the Openstack Operator, *openstack-operator.openstack-operators*:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get operators openstack-operator.openstack-operators
----

. Review the pods in the **openstack-operators** namespace:
+
[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n openstack-operators
----

. If you run:
+
[source, bash,role=execute]
----
oc get pods -n openstack-operators --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
----
+
You should see a list of completed pods and then the running openstack services pods.Ensure that all containers are in the ‘Running’ state before proceeding:
+
