= Create the OpenStack Control Plane

We will be using a preconfigured file (*files/osp-ng-ctlplane-deploy.yaml*) to create the control plane and at the same time enable the required services, configure the control plane network, and configure the service back ends.
The control plane we will be using the NFS server we installed in the previous section to store cinder volumes.

== Prepare the secret to place the NFS server connection used by Cinder

In the bastion:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create secret generic cinder-nfs-config --from-file=nfs-cinder-conf
----

== Finally create the OpenStack control plane

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc create -f osp-ng-ctlplane-deploy.yaml
----

Wait until the OpenStack control plane deployment is completed:

[source,bash,role=execute]
----
oc get openstackcontrolplane -n openstack -w
----

WARNING: This can take several minutes.

Type Control + C, to exit the wait command when you see message "Setup Complete"
